**A Word From Our Pastor**

An insight that Martin Luther and his fellow reformers brought forth as an aid to understanding the Bible has to do with how various passages function. Broadly speaking, he insisted that the voice of Scripture is either speaking as Law, or as Gospel. And Scripture, as the Word of God, speaks in both ways to us.

Sometimes I like to substitute the words Law and Gospel with the words Demand and Promise, for these substitutes help us to understand the distinction. When the voice of God speaks in Scripture of what He has commanded, what He expects of us, and what His will is, this is the Law.

And on the other hand, when His voice communicates His rich promises to us, what He has done, is doing, and will do on our behalf, and when He says “I forgive you your sins,” this is the Gospel.

It is important to understand that God speaks both Law and Gospel to us. We need to hear both words. And it is crucial to recognize that the failure to hear the one will jeopardize our hearing and appreciating the other. We also need to appreciate that these two words have different functions, and these two functions are distinct from each other.

In overly simplistic terms, the Law shows us our sins; and the Gospel shows us our salvation. Now the Law in showing us God’s will at the same time measures how far short we fall in living according to his will. And so it ends up accusing and condemning us. Ouch! That’s no fun.

And the Gospel speaks pure gift and promise as we learn how Christ’s death and resurrection atones for our sins and offers us forgiveness and the promise of life and salvation. Here’s the rub, only those who truly know themselves to be lost and condemned will cling – really cling – to the remedy! And only with the promise and our trust in it do we receive life! All our life we will need ongoing repentance and trust…

**Since You Asked…**

**What good purpose is there in signing oneself (making the sign of the cross with the hand over one’s head and breast)?**

This gesture’s main purpose is to remind us of our baptism where the sign of the cross was first made on our foreheads. The cross is a powerful symbol which reminds us of the depths of God’s love for us – He loved us so much that He sent His Son to die for us. In Holy Baptism we have been joined to Christ. Every time we sign ourselves we declare that we belong to Christ and that we desire to live for Him. We give visible expression that we serve the One, True God who has revealed Himself to us in three persons: the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
